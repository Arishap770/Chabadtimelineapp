    location: "Liozna, Belarus",
    shortDescription: "Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, founder of Chabad Chassidus, was born in Liozna, Belarus. His revolutionary approach would transform Jewish mysticism into an accessible intellectual system.",
    background: "In the decades preceding the birth of the Alter Rebbe, Chassidus was spreading throughout Eastern Europe, revitalizing Jewish life by emphasizing inner sincerity, emotional connection to Hashem, and the spiritual value of every Jew. While this movement brought warmth and vitality, its teachings were often transmitted in concise sayings and inspirational stories, leaving room for misunderstanding and opposition from those who feared a lack of structure or intellectual rigor. At the same time, many sincere seekers desired a framework that could translate Chassidic ideas into a disciplined system of thought—one that could engage the intellect, clarify belief, and provide a stable foundation for lifelong avodah. This historical and spiritual context set the stage for the emergence of a leader who would articulate Chassidus in a precise, systematic, and deeply intellectual form.",
    whatHappened: "On 18 Elul 5505, a date later recognized as one of renewal and vitality in Chassidic history, Rabbi Shneur Zalman was born in the town of Liozna to Rabbi Baruch and Rebbetzin Rivkah. From his earliest years, he displayed extraordinary intellectual sharpness, mastery of revealed Torah, and a deep sensitivity to spiritual matters, earning recognition among leading rabbinic figures of his time while still very young. As he matured, his unique ability to unite rigorous analytical thinking with inner spiritual depth became increasingly apparent, eventually leading him to join the circle of the Maggid of Mezritch, under whose guidance he developed the foundations of what would later become the Chabad approach to Chassidus.",
    aftermathImpact: "The birth of the Alter Rebbe ultimately marked the beginning of a new phase in the development of Chassidus, one in which spiritual inspiration would be paired with intellectual clarity and systematic explanation. Through his later leadership, writings, and teachings, he transformed Chassidus into a disciplined path of avodah that could be studied, analyzed, and internalized by the mind as well as the heart. His formulation of Chabad—emphasizing Chochmah, Binah, and Daas—provided generations of chassidim with tools for sustained spiritual growth, resilience in times of challenge, and a structured approach to divine service. The enduring centrality of his works, especially the Tanya, continues to define Chabad's identity, educational model, and global mission, making his influence not only foundational but ongoing.",

    shortDescription: "Birth of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the Frierdiker Rebbe, the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe. He later became a heroic leader of Soviet Jewry.",
    background: "By the late 19th century, Chabad was firmly established as a major Chassidic movement, centered in the town of Lubavitch and led by Rabbi Sholom DovBer Schneersohn, the Rebbe Rashab. This era was marked by both spiritual growth and increasing external pressures, including political instability, modernization, and rising hostility toward traditional Jewish life within the Russian Empire. Internally, Chabad was emphasizing deeper study of Chassidus, structured education, and disciplined avodah, particularly through the Rashab’s leadership and his vision for strengthening Chassidic identity in changing times. It was into this complex and demanding historical moment that the future Frierdiker Rebbe was born.",
    whatHappened: "Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn was born on 12 Tamuz 5640 (1880) in Lubavitch, the son of Rabbi Sholom DovBer, the fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe. From his youth, he was recognized as a genius in both the revealed and hidden aspects of Torah. He studied intensively with his father and the other great scholars of his generation. His early years were marked by exceptional learning and spiritual development that would later enable him to lead Chabad through unprecedented trials.",
    aftermathImpact: "The birth of the Frierdiker Rebbe would have far-reaching consequences for Chabad and for world Jewry. As Rebbe, he would lead Chabad through the collapse of the Russian Empire, the rise of Soviet oppression, and the destruction of European Jewry, responding with extraordinary courage, organizational skill, and self-sacrifice. His efforts to preserve Torah life under Communist rule, followed by his leadership in rebuilding Chabad in the West, reshaped the movement from a regionally centered Chassidic court into a resilient, globally oriented force. The enduring institutions, educational networks, and spirit of mesirus nefesh that define modern Chabad trace directly back to his leadership and vision.",

    shortDescription: "The Rebbe Rashab established the first Chabad yeshiva in Lubavitch, creating a revolutionary educational institution.",
    background: "In the late 1800s, the yeshiva system in Eastern Europe was well-established, but Chabad sought to create something unique - a place where students would not only master Talmud but also develop a profound understanding of Chassidic philosophy and experiential spirituality. The Rebbe Rashab envisioned an institution that would prepare young men not just for scholarship, but for devoted service of G-d.",
    whatHappened: "On 15 Elul 5657 (August 1897), the Rebbe Rashab founded Tomchei Temimim (Supporters of the Perfect Ones) in Lubavitch. This was the first organized yeshiva established specifically by a Chabad Rebbe. The institution was revolutionary in its approach: students would study Talmud with the rigor and precision of the Lithuanian yeshivas, while simultaneously immersing themselves in Chassidic thought and prayer. The curriculum integrated intellectual study with spiritual development in a way that had not been done before on such a scale.",
    aftermathImpact: "The founding of Tomchei Temimim created the model for all future Chabad yeshivas worldwide. Over the decades, despite wars, persecution, and displacement, this institution continued to function and eventually spread across the globe. Today, there are dozens of Chabad yeshivas bearing the name Tomchei Temimim on six continents. The approach pioneered by the Rebbe Rashab - combining rigorous Talmudic scholarship with Chassidic philosophy - has produced generations of leaders, teachers, and activists who carry Chabad's mission throughout the world. The thousands of graduates of Tomchei Temimim institutions have gone on to establish Chabad centers, lead communities, and inspire countless Jews to deepen their connection to Torah and Chassidic teachings.",

    background: "At the turn of the 20th century, the Chabad movement was facing its most severe challenges. The Russian Empire was becoming increasingly repressive toward Jewish religious life. World War I was on the horizon. The Enlightenment was drawing many young Jews away from tradition. Against this backdrop of uncertainty and challenge, the seventh Rebbe was born.",
    whatHappened: "On 11 Nisan 5662 (April 8, 1902), Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson was born in Nikolayev (Mykolaiv), Ukraine. His birth was welcomed as a sign of Divine providence and hope for the Jewish people. From his earliest years, he displayed extraordinary intellectual abilities combined with deep spiritual sensitivity. His parents and teachers recognized his unique potential to lead and inspire. As he grew up in the tumultuous early decades of the 20th century, his unique combination of brilliant scholarship, Chassidic devotion, and practical leadership would become increasingly apparent.",
    aftermathImpact: "The birth of the seventh Rebbe marked the beginning of a transformation that would eventually touch the entire Jewish world. When he assumed the Rebbe-ship in 1951, he initiated a global movement of outreach and education that fundamentally changed how Jews worldwide - from the most assimilated to the most observant - connected with their heritage. His Mivtzoim campaigns brought Torah and Chassidic teachings to every corner of the globe. His vision of spreading Chabad's message to the furthest reaches of the Jewish world was implemented through a network of emissaries and institutions that continues to grow and expand to this day. The Rebbe transformed Chabad from a primarily Eastern European movement into a global spiritual force that touches the lives of millions of Jews.",

    shortDescription: "Arrest of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the Frierdiker Rebbe, by Soviet authorities.",
    background: "The Soviet Union under Stalin was becoming increasingly hostile to religion and Jewish practice. The government viewed Chabad's efforts to strengthen Jewish education and observance as a threat to communist ideology. Many Jewish communal leaders and rabbis had already been arrested or killed. The Frierdiker Rebbe continued his work of strengthening Jewish life despite the danger, knowing the risks but feeling the spiritual imperative to preserve the Jewish tradition.",
    whatHappened: "On 15 Sivan 5687 (June 1927), the Soviet secret police (GPU/NKVD) arrested Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn. He was accused of counter-revolutionary activities, specifically for his work in establishing Torah schools, running underground yeshivas, and maintaining channels of Jewish life in defiance of communist ideology. He was imprisoned and interrogated. The arrest sent shockwaves through the Jewish world. Rabbis, community leaders, and Jews worldwide were horrified and mobilized to secure his release. International pressure from Jewish communities, governments, and prominent figures mounted on the Soviet authorities.",
    aftermathImpact: "After intense international pressure and negotiations, the Frierdiker Rebbe was released on 12 Av 5687 (August 13, 1927), spending approximately 2 months in captivity. His imprisonment became a symbol of Soviet anti-Semitism and religious persecution. His release was celebrated throughout the Jewish world as a miraculous salvation. The experience strengthened his resolve to continue his work in strengthening Jewish life. Eventually, recognizing that the Soviet Union was becoming increasingly dangerous for Judaism, the Frierdiker Rebbe arranged his escape and made his way to the United States, where he would rebuild Chabad and eventually pass on the leadership to his son-in-law, the future seventh Rebbe. The arrest and release of the Frierdiker Rebbe became a defining moment in Chabad history, demonstrating both the movement's courage in preserving Judaism against tyranny and the power of international solidarity in defense of religious freedom.",

    background: "In Jewish tradition, marriage is considered one of the most sacred and significant life events. The union between the seventh Rebbe and the Rebbetzin was more than a personal marriage - it represented the continuity of Chabad leadership and the bond between two great families of Torah scholarship and Chassidic devotion. The marriage united the Rebbe with the family of the Frierdiker Rebbe, creating the personal connection that would eventually lead to the transfer of leadership to the Rebbe.",
    whatHappened: "On 14 Kislev 5689 (December 1928), Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson married Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka Schneerson, the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the sixth (Frierdiker) Rebbe. The wedding took place in Warsaw, Poland, and was a significant event in the Chabad world. The union of these two individuals - both of whom possessed extraordinary scholarship, spiritual depth, and devotion to the Jewish people - was understood as divinely ordained. The Rebbetzin would prove to be an exceptional partner, supporting the Rebbe's work and serving as a source of strength and wisdom throughout his life.",
    aftermathImpact: "The marriage of the Rebbe and Rebbetzin laid the personal and family foundation for the eventual transfer of Chabad leadership. When the Frierdiker Rebbe passed away in 1950, many within Chabad looked to the Rebbe as the logical successor. On 10 Shevat 5711 (1951), the Rebbe assumed leadership of Chabad-Lubavitch. Throughout the Rebbe's five decades of leadership, the Rebbetzin stood at his side as an indispensable partner in his mission. She advised him, supported him, and served as a powerful figure in her own right in the Chabad community. The Rebbetzin's influence on Jewish women and her role in promoting education and spiritual development among Jewish families was immense. The partnership between the Rebbe and Rebbetzin became a model for Jewish married life - a union dedicated to serving G-d and humanity. The Rebbetzin remained actively involved in Chabad's work until her passing in 1988.",

His arrival marked a historic turning point, establishing America as the new center of Chabad-Lubavitch and ensuring the survival and growth of Chassidic life in freedom.",
    background: "The 1930s saw the rise of Nazi power in Europe and increasing anti-Semitism throughout the continent. The Soviet Union remained hostile to Judaism. The Frierdiker Rebbe, having survived imprisonment in the Soviet Union, recognized the urgent need to ensure Chabad's survival by establishing it in a country where religious freedom could be practiced. America, with its strong Jewish community and constitutional protections for religious liberty, seemed like the place where this could be accomplished.",
    whatHappened: "On 9 Adar 5700 (March 1940), Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the Frierdiker Rebbe, arrived in New York after a harrowing journey from Europe. He came with the intention of establishing Chabad in America and ensuring the movement's continuity in a free country. He arrived with some of his closest disciples and began the work of building institutions to preserve and propagate Chabad teachings. He established headquarters in Brooklyn, which would become the center of global Chabad operations. He immediately began working to strengthen Torah education, establish Chabad institutions, and reach out to American Jews.",
    aftermathImpact: "The Frierdiker Rebbe's arrival in America marked a turning point in both Chabad and Jewish history. In the years following his arrival, he established Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch (an educational organization), Kehot Publication Society (to publish Jewish texts), and began organizing the network of Chabad institutions that would eventually spread worldwide. He personally published his memoirs and writings, preserving crucial documentation of Chabad history. When World War II ended and the Holocaust's full horror became clear, the Frierdiker Rebbe worked tirelessly to help surviving Jews and refugees rebuild their lives. His arrival in America proved providential - it ensured that when his son-in-law, the Rebbe, would assume leadership in 1951, there would be a strong foundation on which to build a global movement. The Chabad presence in America, established by the Frierdiker Rebbe, became the launching point for the exponential global expansion of Chabad in the latter half of the 20th century.",

    shortDescription: "Yom Hilula of Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Schneerson, father of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe. A towering Kabbalist and Rav of Dnepropetrovsk, he endured Soviet persecution and passed away in exile.",
    background: "Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Schneerson lived through one of the darkest periods for Jewish life in Eastern Europe. During the Soviet era, Jewish practice and religious education were strictly forbidden. Rabbi Levi Yitzchok, serving as a rabbi in the Ukrainian city of Dnepropetrovsk (also known as Dnipro), became a target of Soviet persecution for his devoted leadership of the Jewish community and his refusal to abandon his religious principles. His unwavering commitment to Judaism and his deep Kabbalistic knowledge made him a spiritual beacon for Jews under Soviet rule, even as the government worked to eradicate religious life.",
    whatHappened: "Due to Soviet persecution, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok was exiled to Alma-Ata (Almaty), Kazakhstan, one of the harshest regions of the Soviet Union, where thousands of political and religious prisoners were sent. Despite the brutal conditions of exile, he continued to teach and inspire his followers, maintaining his deep spiritual practice and scholarly pursuits even in the most difficult circumstances. On 20 Av 5704 (August 1944), Rabbi Levi Yitzchok passed away in exile, far from his family and community, having endured years of persecution and hardship for refusing to compromise his faith. His passing occurred while his son, Rabbi Menachem Mendel (the future Seventh Rebbe), was in America, building what would become the global Chabad movement.",
    aftermathImpact: "Rabbi Levi Yitzchok's sacrifice and spiritual courage became a defining example in Chabad history of mesirus nefesh—complete self-sacrifice for the sake of faith and Jewish continuity. Though he died in exile, his legacy lived on through his son, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who frequently spoke about his father's teachings and example. The Rebbe honored his father's memory through countless teachings and teachings devoted to his legacy. Rabbi Levi Yitzchok's life and martyrdom became emblematic of Chabad's response to Soviet persecution: unwavering commitment to Torah and Judaism regardless of the cost. His yahrzeit is commemorated as a day of reflection on spiritual strength, perseverance under persecution, and the transmission of faith across generations even in the darkest times. The Rebbe's own approach to outreach and Chabad's global expansion can be understood as fulfilling his father's vision of spreading Jewish knowledge and practice despite all obstacles.",

    shortDescription: "Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson and Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka Schneerson arrived in the United States, joining the Frierdiker Rebbe in New York. Their arrival marked the beginning of the Rebbe’s active involvement in building and strengthening Chabad institutions in America, laying the groundwork for his future leadership.",
    background: "After the Frierdiker Rebbe's arrival in America, World War II was in full force. The Nazi regime was implementing its horrific Final Solution. Most of European Jewry would be destroyed in the Holocaust. The Rebbe and Rebbetzin had been living in Poland and France, trying to survive in occupied Europe. The arrival of the Rebbe and Rebbetzin in America represented not just their personal rescue, but the preservation of Chabad leadership that would prove crucial to the movement's future.",
    whatHappened: "On 28 Sivan 5701 (June 23 1941), after a perilous journey through wartime Europe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel and Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka Schneerson arrived in New York, joining the Frierdiker Rebbe who had arrived the previous year. Their arrival was greeted with joy by the Chabad community, but also with the knowledge that they had just escaped from a continent rapidly descending into unspeakable evil. The Rebbe immediately began working with the Frierdiker Rebbe and became increasingly active in Chabad's organizational work. He took on responsibility for Kehot Publication Society and Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch. He also began his pioneering work in Jewish outreach and education that would later define his Rebbe-ship.",
    aftermathImpact: "The arrival of the Rebbe and Rebbetzin in America proved to be one of the most consequential events in modern Jewish history. In the years following their arrival, the Rebbe gradually took on greater responsibility in Chabad's operations. After the Frierdiker Rebbe's passing in 1950, the Rebbe formally assumed leadership in 1951, initiating a transformation that would change the face of American Judaism and eventually the entire Jewish world. The Rebbe's arrival in America at this critical juncture - just before the Holocaust reached its terrible crescendo - meant that Chabad's leadership would survive and continue. From America, the Rebbe would launch the Mivtzoim campaigns, establishing Chabad centers in every corner of the world and bringing the teachings and warmth of Chabad Chassidus to millions of Jews. The Rebbe and Rebbetzin's arrival in America, following the Frierdiker Rebbe's arrival a year earlier, ensured the continuity and expansion of Chabad in ways that could hardly have been imagined at the time.",

Despite these unprecedented challenges, he had successfully established Chabad in America and was gradually handing over increasing responsibility to his son-in-law, the Rebbe.

    whatHappened: "On 10 Shevat 5710 (January 28, 1950), Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, passed away. He was 70 years old. His passing came at a time when Chabad was beginning to flourish in America, when Holocaust survivors were beginning to rebuild their lives, and when the movement had established a solid foundation in the United States. The date of his passing - 10 Shevat - would become eternally significant in Chabad history.",
    aftermathImpact: "The passing of the Frierdiker Rebbe created a succession question that was resolved a year later when [the Rebbe formally assumed leadership on 10 Shevat 5711](/event/kabolas-hanisius-rebbe \"The Rebbe Accepts the Nesius|/10-shvat.jpg\") (1951). The Frierdiker Rebbe's forty-year leadership had been marked by courageous spiritual leadership in the face of persecution, and his successful establishment of Chabad in America had created the platform from which the Rebbe would launch his revolutionary transformation of Chabad and global Jewish life. The Frierdiker Rebbe's passing was mourned throughout the Jewish world, and his legacy as a hero of faith, a preserver of Judaism in dark times, and a visionary leader continues to inspire Chabad to this day. The 10th of Shevat is commemorated annually by Chabad as a day of reflection on the Frierdiker Rebbe's legacy and his mission to strengthen Judaism.",

    background: "Following the passing of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the Frierdiker Rebbe, on 10 Shevat 5710, Chabad Chassidim experienced a full year without a formally declared Rebbe. During this time, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson emerged as the spiritual leader through his guidance, sichos, and direction of Chabad institutions, while steadfastly refusing any official title.",
    whatHappened: "On 10 Shevat 5711, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson formally accepted the nesius of Chabad-Lubavitch at a farbrengen held on the first yahrzeit of the Frierdiker Rebbe. During the gathering, he delivered the maamar Basi L’Gani, continuing and expanding upon the final maamar of the Frierdiker Rebbe, thereby publicly assuming leadership and defining the central mission of the generation—to draw the Divine Presence into the physical world through Torah, mitzvos, and active shlichus.",
    aftermathImpact: "The acceptance of the nesius on 10 Shevat 5711 ushered in a new and unprecedented era in Chabad history. Under the Rebbe’s leadership, Chabad transformed into a global movement, with shluchim sent to communities across the world to strengthen Jewish education, observance, and identity. The themes introduced in Basi L’Gani became foundational to the Rebbe’s vision, emphasizing action, responsibility, and bringing holiness into the physical world, shaping decades of outreach, learning, and spiritual vitality that continue to define Chabad today.",

The victory was seen as a spiritual triumph affirming the eternal ownership of Torah by Klal Yisrael.",
    background: "Following the passing of the Frierdiker Rebbe in 5710, a dispute arose regarding a large portion of the Chabad library, consisting of rare manuscripts, seforim, and writings collected by the Rebbeim over generations. A relative of the Frierdiker Rebbe claimed personal ownership of these sacred texts, leading to a prolonged legal battle in secular court. The Rebbe viewed the case not merely as a legal matter, but as a fundamental question of whether Torah is private property or belongs to the Jewish people and the Chabad movement as a whole.",
    whatHappened: "On 5 Teves 5747 (January 6, 1987), the U.S. District Court ruled decisively that the seforim belong to Agudas Chasidei Chabad, the official organization of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. The Rebbe expressed deep satisfaction with the ruling, referring to it as Didan Notzach and encouraging widespread celebration. In response, Chassidim around the world marked the day with farbrengens, dancing, and a renewed emphasis on purchasing, learning, and expanding Torah libraries, especially the Rebbe’s call to strengthen personal and communal seforim collections.",
    aftermathImpact: "Hei Teves became an annual Chabad yom tov symbolizing the victory of Torah, the collective ownership of sacred knowledge, and the responsibility to spread learning. The Rebbe emphasized that the true continuation of Didan Notzach lies in increasing Torah study, printing seforim, and establishing Jewish libraries everywhere. To this day, Chabad communities commemorate Hei Teves with farbrengens, book fairs, and renewed commitments to Torah learning, reinforcing the idea that Torah is living, eternal, and belongs to all of Am Yisrael.",

This period was marked by both rapid spiritual growth and strong opposition, requiring clarity, precision, and depth in the articulation of Chassidic ideas.

    shortDescription: "On 19 Kislev 5557, the Tanya was first published, marking the formal foundation of Chabad philosophy in written form. This work became the central text of Chabad Chassidus, guiding generations in understanding the soul, divine service, and the purpose of life.",
    background: "Before the Tanya was published, the Alter Rebbe and those who came before him taught Chassidus primarily through oral teachings and handwritten notes copied by students. These copies were often inaccurate or incomplete, leading to confusion and misrepresentation of his teachings. At the same time, many Chassidim struggled to apply deep spiritual ideas consistently in daily life, especially without direct access to a Rebbe. The Alter Rebbe recognized the need for a clear, authoritative text that would preserve Chassidus accurately and make it accessible to every Jew.",
    whatHappened: "The Alter Rebbe carefully edited and organized his teachings into a structured work, presenting a systematic approach to understanding the Jewish soul, the struggle between good and evil inclinations, and how to serve God with intellect and emotion. When the Tanya was published, it provided Chassidim with a reliable guide that could be studied repeatedly and independently. The book was written with precision and depth, yet designed to be practical, offering guidance for real spiritual challenges rather than abstract theory.",
    aftermathImpact: "The publication of the Tanya transformed Chabad from a movement centered around a living teacher into one anchored by a foundational text. It allowed Chassidus to spread far beyond the Alter Rebbe’s physical reach and ensured consistency in teaching across communities. Over time, the Tanya became known as the “Written Torah of Chassidus,” studied daily by Chassidim worldwide. Its influence shaped all later Chabad teachings and remains the backbone of Chabad education, identity, and practice.",

    shortDescription: "On 19 Kislev 5559, the Alter Rebbe was released from imprisonment in St. Petersburg after 53 days of confinement. This day is celebrated as the 'Rosh Hashanah of Chassidus,' marking a spiritual victory that allowed Chabad teachings to spread openly and with renewed strength.",
    background: "In the late 18th century, Chassidus faced strong opposition from both ideological opponents, known as 'misnagdim', and government suspicion. The Alter Rebbe’s systemized approach to Chassidus, along with his leadership and influence, drew attention from critics who accused him of political disloyalty and financial misconduct. These accusations were brought to the Russian authorities, leading to his arrest. Beyond the physical danger, Chassidim understood this imprisonment as a spiritual challenge to the legitimacy and future of Chabad Chassidus itself.",
    whatHappened: "The Alter Rebbe was arrested and taken to St. Petersburg, where he was interrogated by government officials. During his imprisonment, he remained calm and spiritually focused, answering questions with clarity and confidence. After a thorough investigation, the authorities found no wrongdoing. On 19 Kislev 5559, he was formally released and allowed to return home. His release was not merely a personal salvation, but a public vindication of his teachings and leadership.",
    aftermathImpact: "The liberation of the Alter Rebbe marked a turning point in Chabad history. It was understood by Chassidim as a heavenly approval to spread Chassidus more openly and more deeply. Following his release, the Alter Rebbe expanded his teaching efforts, and Chabad entered a new phase of growth and confidence. The day became an annual celebration, symbolizing freedom of the soul, clarity in divine service, and the power of Chassidus to overcome both spiritual and physical opposition. To this day, 19 Kislev is celebrated worldwide as a festival of redemption.",

The Alter Rebbe was liberated from his first imprisonment on Yud-Tes Kislev, on Tuesday of the week in which Parshas Vayeishev is read, 5559 (1798), before dusk. From a letter of the Alter Rebbe:
This fact must be made known: [On] the day that G‑d made for us, Yud-Tes Kislev — [which in the year 5559 fell on a] Tuesday, the day concerning which the phrase “it was good” was repeated, and which is the yahrzeit of our holy teacher (the Maggid), whose soul is in Eden — when I read the verse in the Book of Tehillim, “He redeemed my soul in peace,” and before I began the next verse, I emerged in peace [thanks to] the G‑d of peace. This is a day for farbrengens, and for making positive resolutions to set fixed times for public Torah study, both in nigleh and Chassidus, and for strengthening the paths of chassidic conduct with brotherly love. It is customary [on this day] to apportion the tractates of the Talmud [to be studied by the members of the local chassidic brotherhood] according to the pattern described in Tanya — Iggeres HaKodesh, in the epistle beginning Hocheiach Tochiach. In Lubavitch, from 5663 (1902) onward, the tractates were apportioned on 24 Teves — the Alter Rebbe’s yahrzeit — because of the lack of time on Yud-Tes Kislev.`],

    shortDescription: "Passing of Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, the Alter Rebbe, founder of Chabad-Lubavitch. He had been in ill health after fleeing Napoleon's invasion of Russia and passed away in Liadi. The Alter Rebbe was renowned for founding Chabad philosophy, authoring the Tanya, and establishing the framework for Chabad Chassidus. 24 Teves is observed by Chassidim as his yahrzeit, a day of Torah study, reflection, and inspiration drawn from his teachings.",
    background: "In 1812, Europe was engulfed in the Napoleonic Wars, which reached the Russian Empire and endangered Jewish communities across the region. The Alter Rebbe strongly opposed Napoleon, believing that while political freedom might improve material conditions, it would weaken Jewish spiritual commitment. As the French army advanced, the Alter Rebbe fled with his family and followers, enduring harsh winter conditions. The physical strain of travel, combined with his advanced age and weakened health, took a severe toll.",
    whatHappened: "During the journey eastward, the Alter Rebbe’s condition deteriorated rapidly. On 24 Teves 5573, he passed away in the village of Piena. His passing occurred far from his home, in the midst of exile and upheaval, reflecting a life devoted entirely to the Jewish people even under the most difficult circumstances. He was later brought to be buried in Haditch, which became a major place of pilgrimage for Chassidim.",
    aftermathImpact: "The passing of the Alter Rebbe marked a profound transition for Chabad. While his physical leadership ended, the foundations he laid ensured continuity and growth. His successor, the Mitteler Rebbe, expanded and clarified his teachings, while later Rebbeim continued to develop Chabad philosophy. The Alter Rebbe’s works—especially the Tanya and his legal rulings—remained central texts, shaping Jewish life and Chassidic thought far beyond his generation. His passing is commemorated as a time of reflection on leadership, sacrifice, and the transmission of spiritual truth.",

His acceptance of the nesius brought continuity to the movement while also introducing a new emphasis on extended explanation and intellectual clarity in the study of Chassidus. This moment marked the beginning of a distinct era in Chabad history, in which Chassidic teachings were expanded, organized, and taught in a way that allowed them to be deeply understood and internalized by a wider audience.",
    background: "The Alter Rebbe’s passing on 24 Teves 5573 left Chabad at a moment of transition and uncertainty. As the founder of the movement, his leadership had shaped every aspect of Chabad philosophy and practice. During his lifetime, Rabbi DovBer Schneuri had already emerged as his foremost disciple, known for his extraordinary intellectual depth and ability to explain complex Chassidic ideas at great length and clarity. Chassidim looked to him naturally as the successor, though the formal acceptance of leadership required spiritual readiness, communal recognition, and divine alignment.",
    whatHappened: "Shortly after his father's passing, Rabbi DovBer Schneuri formally accepted the role of Rebbe and assumed responsibility for leading Chabad-Lubavitch. From the outset of his nesius, he emphasized structured learning, intellectual clarity, and extended contemplation of Chassidic concepts. He later established the town of Lubavitch as the central hub of the movement, creating an environment devoted to deep study, spiritual discipline, and communal growth. His leadership style reflected an expansion of his father’s teachings rather than a departure from them.",
    aftermathImpact: "The beginning of the Mitteler Rebbe’s nesius marked a major shift in how Chassidus was taught and experienced. Under his leadership, Chassidic ideas were expanded into lengthy discourses that allowed students to fully grasp and internalize them. This approach strengthened the intellectual foundation of Chabad and influenced all subsequent generations of Rebbeim. His nesius ensured that Chabad remained a movement rooted in understanding, depth, and internalization, setting a lasting standard for Chassidic study and spiritual growth.",

In contrast,undergoing a [personal, spiritual] “exodus from Egypt” in the chassidic sense involvesrefining (beirur) and rectifying (tikkun) — liberating oneself from the limits and boundaries of the world, while remaining in the world. In other words, while being involved in this world, one ought to constantly aspire to be outside its bounds. One must remove the confinements and restraints and perceive the truth — that the world itself is in fact good, for after all, this is what G‑d willed.

Throughout his imprisonment, he remained composed and steadfast, continuing to represent Chabad with clarity and dignity.

    whatHappened: "On 2 Nisan 5680 (April 1920), Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn formally assumed the nesius of Chabad-Lubavitch following the passing of his father-in-law, the Rebbe Rashab. Though only forty years old, he immediately took decisive action to preserve Torah life and Chabad institutions under Soviet oppression. He established underground yeshivas, maintained Torah study networks, and strengthened Chabad's organizational structure despite severe governmental restrictions.",
    aftermathImpact: "The Frierdiker Rebbe's nesius transformed Chabad during its darkest hours. Despite imprisonment in 1927, he continued his work until recognizing that Soviet persecution would make Jewish life impossible. He arranged his escape and eventually arrived in America in 1940, establishing Brooklyn as the new center of Chabad's global operations. His forty-year nesius—marked by uncompromising dedication to preserving Judaism and helping survivors rebuild—created the foundation upon which his son-in-law, the seventh Rebbe, would launch an unprecedented global expansion. The Frierdiker Rebbe demonstrated that even under totalitarian oppression, Torah and Chassidus could not be extinguished, and Jewish life could be preserved and renewed.",

    shortDescription: "Passing of Reb Yisroel Aryeh Leib Schneerson, the Rebbe's younger brother. A brilliant Torah scholar living in England, his passing was deeply mourned by the Rebbe and the entire Chabad community.",
    background: "Rabbi Yisroel Aryeh Leib was the younger brother of the Rebbe. Unlike the Rebbe, who became the seventh leader of Chabad, Yisroel Aryeh Leib chose to pursue a life of Torah scholarship and teaching in England. He was deeply learned in both the revealed and hidden dimensions of Torah, and established himself as a respected scholar and educator in the Liverpool Jewish community.",
    whatHappened: "On 13 Iyar 5712 (1952), Reb Yisroel Aryeh Leib Schneerson passed away in Liverpool, England. His passing was particularly significant as it occurred while the Rebbe was in the early years of his transformative leadership of Chabad. Though separated by ocean and distance, the Rebbe and his brother shared a deep bond rooted in their family legacy and shared commitment to Torah.",
    aftermathImpact: "The Rebbe mourned his brother deeply, dedicating several talks and letters to Yisroel Aryeh Leib's memory. The Rebbe spoke of his brother's extraordinary scholarship, his devotion to Jewish education, and the unique role he played in the family's spiritual work. The Rebbe's teachings about his brother reveal the depth of family connection in Chabad, transcending geography and different life paths. Yisroel Aryeh Leib's legacy as a distinguished Torah scholar and dedicated educator continues to inspire Chabad members worldwide. His example demonstrates that serving the Jewish people through study and teaching is a vital path in the Chabad worldview, even when it does not take the form of institutional leadership.",

    background: "Rebbetzin Chana was born in 1880 and grew up in the Chabad world as the daughter of Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn (the Rebbe Maharash). She was married to Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Schneerson, a renowned Kabbalist and Chief Rabbi of Yekaterinoslav (Dnepropetrovsk), Ukraine. Throughout her life, she witnessed significant events in Jewish and world history, from the Russian Revolution to World War II to the establishment of the State of Israel.",
    whatHappened: "On 6 Tishrei 5725 (1964), Rebbetzin Chana Schneerson passed away in Brooklyn, New York, at the age of 84. She had been living in America since 1946, after escaping the Soviet Union where her husband, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak, had suffered greatly for his efforts to preserve Torah life. Her passing was mourned throughout the Jewish world, as she represented a generation of Jewish women whose faith sustained their families through unprecedented persecution.",
    aftermathImpact: "Rebbetzin Chana's life exemplified the strength and resilience of Jewish women in the face of tyranny. The Rebbe honored her memory through numerous teachings and discourses devoted to her legacy and her role in his upbringing. He spoke of her tremendous faith, her devoted service to her family and the Jewish people, and her enduring commitment to Torah values even during the darkest times. The Rebbe's published collections, such as 'Likkutei Sichos,' contain many references to teachings and stories from his mother, showing how profoundly her influence shaped his worldview. Rebbetzin Chana's memory lives on as a model of maternal devotion, faith in divine providence, and uncompromising commitment to Jewish tradition.",

    shortDescription: "The Rebbe launches Mivtza Tefillin during the Six-Day War, encouraging Jews worldwide to put on tefillin daily. This marked the beginning of the Rebbe's revolutionary global Mivtzoim campaigns.",
    background: "In the 1960s, the Jewish world was experiencing rapid secularization and assimilation. Many Jews, particularly young people, were drifting away from Jewish practice. Simultaneously, the Six-Day War in 1967 created a moment of global awareness of Israel and Jewish identity. The Rebbe recognized this moment as an opportunity to inspire Jews everywhere to strengthen their connection to Torah and mitzvos through concrete, achievable actions.",
    whatHappened: "On 28 Iyar 5727 (1967), in response to the Six-Day War, the Rebbe launched Mivtza Tefillin—a campaign encouraging every Jewish male to put on tefillin daily. The Rebbe sent Chabad emissaries into the streets with portable tefillin, approaching Jewish men and encouraging them to perform this mitzvah. The Rebbe explained that tefillin, which are placed on the head and arm, symbolize bringing divine consciousness into daily life and action.",
    aftermathImpact: "Mivtza Tefillin became the first of many Mivtzoim campaigns initiated by the Rebbe, marking a turning point in Chabad's approach to Jewish outreach. Rather than waiting for people to come to Chabad centers, the Rebbe sent Chabad members into the community to meet Jews where they were and inspire them to reconnect with their heritage through specific mitzvos. Subsequent Mivtzoim included Mivtza Tzitzit (fringes), Mivtza Mezuzah (doorpost scrolls), and many others. These campaigns transformed Chabad from a movement centered on scholarly study into a dynamic force of Jewish outreach and education. The Mivtzoim approach proved remarkably effective, touching the lives of millions of Jews worldwide and strengthening Jewish identity and practice across all demographics. Today, over fifty years later, Chabad shluchim continue the Rebbe's Mivtzoim campaigns, adapting them for contemporary contexts while maintaining the core vision of bringing every Jew closer to Torah and mitzvos.",

    background: "The Rebbe had been the leader of Chabad for over 25 years, conducting an extraordinarily demanding schedule of work, learning, and leadership. He would often work late into the night, answering letters, delivering sichos (talks), and making crucial decisions for Chabad's global operations. Despite his advancing age and the physical demands of his role, the Rebbe maintained an unrelenting pace, driven by his commitment to spreading Torah and Chassidus worldwide.",
    whatHappened: "On 22 Tishrei 5738 (1977), during the Sukkot holiday (specifically on Shemini Atzeres), the Rebbe suffered a severe heart attack. The news sent shockwaves through the Chabad world and Jewish communities everywhere. The Rebbe was hospitalized and his condition was serious, raising concerns about his future ability to lead. However, his recovery was gradual but steady. By 1 Kislev 5738 (November 1977), the Rebbe had recovered sufficiently to return home.",
    aftermathImpact: "The Rebbe's recovery from his heart attack was celebrated throughout Chabad as a miraculous salvation. Rosh Chodesh Kislev (the first day of the month of Kislev) was established as Yom Simchah (Day of Joy) in commemoration of his return to health and public leadership. Despite the severity of his heart attack, the Rebbe continued his work without diminishing his involvement in Chabad's global operations. In fact, the years following his recovery witnessed an intensification of the Rebbe's Mivtzoim campaigns and a deepening of his focus on preparing the Jewish people for the coming of Moshiach. The Rebbe's recovery demonstrated to his followers the power of faith and prayer, and reinforced their belief in divine providence. For Chabad, his survival and continued leadership during this critical period was seen as essential to the movement's mission, ensuring that the Rebbe's vision of transforming the entire Jewish world would continue to be pursued with undiminished vigor.",
